# Commit Message Creator Skill
When a user asks you to create a Git commit message, please follow these steps:

# Specification Check:
1. Ensure the commit message follows the project's conventions, such as feat, fix, refactor, build, chore, etc.
2. Ensure the commit message contains a brief description and necessary details.
3. Ensure the commit message does not exceed 72 characters.
